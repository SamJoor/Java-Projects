# Java-Projects
Java Projects I have done:

BarberShop: The BarberShop program simulates customers arriving at a barber shop by using a queue. I use a circular queue to simulate customers waiting in the barber shop the size of this queue is equal to the number of chairs available.

Sorting: 

Monster: Monster is a program that has objects (Ogre, Giant and Dragon) which all have their own health, strength values and attacking strategies. When the program is run the monsters fight and the winner is the last monster with a positive health value.
